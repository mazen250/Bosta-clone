Hello Bosta Team,

This is Mazen Alahwani. I'm excited to introduce the project which is a clone of the Bosta tracking system. This project aims to replicate the core features of Bosta's package tracking functionality, providing a streamlined and efficient user experience.

As part of my assessment for the front-end job application at Bosta, I chose Vite over Create React App for faster renders and more optimization. I used Zustand for state management because it is simple, fast, and has a small bundle size. For localization and internationalization, I utilized i18n, and I preserved language preferences using localStorage.

### Installation Commands
To get started with this project, you can follow these simple installation commands:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mazen250/Bosta-clone.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd bosta-clone
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
Alternatively, you can view the deployed application at:

Thank you for taking the time to review my project. I appreciate the opportunity to apply for the front-end position at Bosta and look forward to potentially contributing to your team.
